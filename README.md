# deepstream-fun
Ryan's collection of resources for building an running deepstream applications. These tools are not intended to replace <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/metropolis/deepstream/dev-guide/">the Offical NVIDIA Deepstream documentiation</a> but rather to aid in setting up a demo system as fast as possible without the need to understand the underlying system components.

I've included several methods to get up and running on NVIDIA deepstream.
